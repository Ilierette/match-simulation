After download project run

Teams are in simple map, that is updated later with values, so it can work with as many teams as possible, not only 3 sets mentioned, so it can be easilly scallable.
After React 16+ I didn't worked much more with Mobx, I could use useReducer instead, so far it's simple useState. I'm trying to use not so many libraries if it's possible.

I don't have any experience with unit testing during my whole carrier, but I'm open to learn.

Simple scss and timer added for visual effects.
